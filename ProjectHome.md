# <font color='red'>django-compress is no longer maintained</font> #

This project has not seen any updates in a long time. I have simply not had the time to keep it up to date.

When django-compress started, there were no other asset managers for Django. Today, it looks quite different, with a wide variety of high quality packages. I am glad to see that some of the code and ideas has been the foundation for other asset managers.

Since there are so many other awesome alternatives today, and I am not going to maintain django-compress anymore.

## Are you looking for an asset manager for your project? ##

See http://djangopackages.com/grids/g/asset-managers/ for a fairly complete list of available asset managers for Django.

## Are you already using django-compress? ##
If you already are already using django-compress, you should have a look at upgrading to django-pipeline, which is a well maintained fork, with a lot of new features. I encourage everyone to who is using django-compress to switch to django-pipeline instead:

#summary Describes how to use django-compress when it is installed and configured

= Automated generation =
If `COMPRESS` and `COMPRESS_AUTO` is enabled (`True`), the source files and the target files will be scanned when Django starts, and re-generated if needed. The last modified time of the files will be compared, and if any of the source-files is newer than the output-file, the file will be re-generated.

= Management command =
You can update and force updates of the compressed file(s) with the management command “synccompress”. This makes it possible to update the compressed files manually without restarting the Django server.

The command is
{{{ ./manage.py compress }}}
(assuming you are in you project-folder that contains `manage.py`. To force all files to be re-generated, use the argument `--force` (e.g. `./manage.py synccompress --force`)

= Templatetags =
django-compress includes two template tags: compressed_css and compressed_js, in a template library called `compressed`

They are used to output the <link> and <script>-tags for the specified CSS/JavaScript-groups (as specified in the settings). The first argument must be the name of the CSS/JavaScript group.

== Example ==
{{{
{% load compressed %}
{% compressed_css 'group_one' %}
{% compressed_js 'all' %}
}}}

Depending of the `COMPRESS` setting, this will output the approriate <link> and <script> tags, for the source files, or for the compressed files.

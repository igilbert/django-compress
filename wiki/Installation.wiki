#summary Installation instructions for django-compress

Installation is pretty straight-forward and follows the same installation procedure as many other Django applications. django-compress does not create any models, so you do not need to configure a database.

== Recommendations ==
By default django-compress uses CSSTidy to compress CSS. CSSTidy is an excellent stand-alone application for dealing with CSS-files. CSSTidy can be downloaded from: http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/. If you do not install CSSTidy, make sure to disable the filter in your settings (by setting COMPRESS_CSS_FILTERS = None).

== Install instructions ==
 # Put the “compress”-folder somewhere on your PYTHONPATH
 # Add “compress” to your INSTALLED_APPS

A setup.py-script for installations with distutils ("python setup.py install") will be provided soon.

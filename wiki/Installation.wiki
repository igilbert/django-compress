#summary Installation instructions for django-compress

Installation is pretty straight-forward and follows the same installation procedure as many other Django applications. django-compress does not create any models, so you do not need to configure a database.

== Recommendations ==
By default django-compress uses CSSTidy to compress CSS. CSSTidy is an excellent stand-alone application for dealing with CSS-files. CSSTidy can be downloaded from: http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/. If you do not install CSSTidy, make sure to disable the filter in your settings (by setting COMPRESS_CSS_FILTERS = None).

== Install instructions ==
 # Get the code from svn: `svn co svn checkout http://django-compress.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-compress`
 #
  # Use the `setup.py` script to install: `python setup.py install`
  # OR manually put the `compress`-directory somewhere on your PYTHONPATH
 # Add `'compress'` to your INSTALLED_APPS
